# Personal Website

Note: This is a website I'm building for my own portfolio. If you take any code from this project, make sure to include credit.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine: (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Once you've cloned or downloaded this project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the following command to install any necessary dependencies:

npm install
```

### Launching the project
To start the development server, run the following command:

This will start the server and open your default browser to your localhost. The site will reload automatically as you make changes to the code.
